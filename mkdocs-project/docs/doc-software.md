## What is an Software? ##

Software is code (computer instructions) packaged in a way that can be run as a program to
accomplish some task.
Some software is interpreted, such as Python (which can be run by the Python interpreter software)
and JavaScript (which can be run by a web browser).
Some software is compiled into executable programs, such as programs that are part of the Windows and Linux operating systems,
or modeling software, and is directly run by the operating system.

## Software User Documentation Fundamentals ##

To allow effective use of software, the input, functionality, and output of the software must be understood.

## Software Administrator Documentation Fundamentals ##

Administrator documentation is that used by people who install and support the software,
but do not necessarily use or develop the software.
For example, a database administrator may setup database servers.
Such documentation may only be relevant for complex software systems that serves multiple users
within an organization.

## Software Developer Documentation Fundamentals ##

It is also often important to create separate documentation for software developers,
which explains how the software is designed, and how to setup and use the development environment.

## Documentation Approach Decision ##

1. If the software is very simple, such as a single script run from a specific folder,
use a [Markdown](ref-markdown) `README.md` file in the folder where the software exists.
2. If a navigable, searchable, interactive web document is desired, consider using a static website such as MkDocs.
3. If the documentation must be distributed as a single document, use traditional [Word/PDF](ref-word-pdf) format.
