## What is a Project? ##

A project is work effort that results in delivered results that are tangible in some way,
including creating data, defining and implementing processes, developing and releasing software, etc.
A project often includes governance such as scope, schedule, management, and other resources.

Rather than delve into the area of pure project management, this page focuses on
projects that are a collection of the topics discussed elsewhere in this overall document,
for example an open source software project that is an umbrella for multiple programs, APIs, documents, etc.

## Project Documentation Options ##

Options for documenting projects depend on the details and scope of the project.

### Software Project ###

Documentation for software projects will for the most part consist of documentation for each software tool.
For example, follow the recommendations for [Documenting Software](doc-software).
However, it may also be necessary to create umbrella software project documentation that sits above several software tools.

* Use built-in features of [GitHub](ref-github) for a software projects,
starting with basic `README.md` file on the repository, then consider using GitHub Pages static website using [Jeckyll](ref-jeckyll) or [MkDocs](ref-mkdocs).
* If GitHub Pages are not used directly, host the documentation to a location other than GitHub, such as Amazon S3 static website.
