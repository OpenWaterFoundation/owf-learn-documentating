## What is a Project? ##

A project is work effort that results in delivered results that are tangible in some way,
including creating data, defining and implementing processes, developing and releasing software, etc.
A project often includes governance such as scope, schedule, management, and other resources.

Rather than delve into the area of pure project management, this page focuses on
projects that are a collection of the topics discussed elsewhere in this overall document,

However, it may also be necessary to create umbrella software project documentation that sits above several software tools.

* Use built-in features of [GitHub](ref-github) for project pages.
